# spring-boot-with-kafka
microservices project using kafka and spring boot for REST api

Our groups could never communicate agreed data being sent between the apps, but this is a working REST API that uses Kafka internally to
produce and consume messages.
MongoDB has been added, but with a couple of problems needed to be worked out before used.
